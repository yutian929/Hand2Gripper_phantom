Action Processor Module

This module processes hand motion capture data and converts it into robot-executable actions.
It handles both single-arm and bimanual robotic setups, converting detected hand keypoints
into end-effector positions, orientations, and gripper widths that can be used for robot control.

Key Features:
- Converts hand keypoints from camera frame to robot frame
- Supports both unconstrained and physically constrained hand models
- Handles missing hand detections with interpolation
- Processes bimanual data with union-based frame selection
- Generates neutral poses when no hand data is available

The processor follows this pipeline:
1. Load hand sequence data (keypoints, detection flags)
2. Convert keypoints to robot coordinate frame
3. Apply hand model constraints (optional)
4. Extract end-effector poses and gripper states
5. Refine actions to handle missing detections
6. Save processed actions for robot execution
